# monitor-input-switch

I had a client who required us to do dev work on laptops provided by the client, so I was juggling two machines. At about the same time, I got a nice new 40-inch monitor, which could do a split screen between the two laptops. The monitor came with a remote to control it, but it also came with a serial port and documentation for commands to control it. I thought wiring up these bobbleheads to the serial port would be more fun than the remote.
